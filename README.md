`byte_type` is a small helper module for efficiently working with different raw
types represented as a bunch of bytes. Now with performance being close to
native js performance and ergonomic interfaces!

## Usage

```ts
import { PackedStruct, u32, u8 } from "https://deno.land/x/byte_type/mod.ts";

const o = new PackedStruct({ "b": u8, "a": u32 }).view(
  new DataView(new ArrayBuffer(5)),
  0,
);

console.log(o.valueOf());
```
